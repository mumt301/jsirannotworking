        <h1> About me</h1>
        <p>
            I am a 22 French student at Mcgill Univeristy. 
            I studied Mathematics and Music Technologies.
            I also just got back from a year abroad at UCLA where I studied Film Scoring and Screenwritting.

            I have a classical background - 12 years of music theory, harmony and counterpoint - and have played various instruments throughout the years (violin, piano, guitar, double bass).
            I wish I had learned a wind instrument at a young age though.

            For a few years I have really been into producing, mixing and mastering. I use Logic Pro, Ableton and Protools to that end

            I lately also got into Max/Msp (thanks to the M.A.T minor!).
            Building electric guitars has always been a dream of mine and I had the chance to work with James Trussart in LA (check him out he made guitars for litterally all of the rockstars you could think of).
            I also know a bit about Arduinos and am currently designing an instrument using my (small) knowledge of electronics and Arduino.

            Other than that I want to learn about AI and maybe Video Game Scoring.
